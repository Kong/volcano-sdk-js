- Before pushing changes, run `pnpm lint`.
- Use Conventional Commits with a scope, like `fix(component): describe the change`.

## Documentation

Everything under `docs/` is **published** — CI syncs it to the public developer
docs site (`Kong/volcano-docs`). So `docs/` is for **end-user-facing docs only**:
the SDK API, options, and behavior a Volcano user relies on.

**When you add or change user-facing behavior, update the matching doc under
`docs/` in the same PR.** Do **not** put internal or maintainer material in
`docs/` — internal-only env vars and test/build knobs, design notes, or
implementation detail. That lives **next to the code it describes**: a code
comment, or a notes/README file in the relevant package — never under `docs/`,
which is the sync target. When unsure whether something is meant for users, keep
it out of `docs/`.

Every doc must follow the Volcano docs format
(https://github.com/Kong/volcano-docs/blob/main/spec/markdown-format.md):

- YAML frontmatter with **`title`** and **`description`** (both required).
- **No H1 in the body** — the title comes from frontmatter; start at `##`.
- `kebab-case.md` filenames; `_index.md` (or `README.md`) for a section landing.
- Every fenced code block declares a language.

The shared lint (`.github/workflows/lint-docs.yml`) validates this on PRs that
touch `docs/`, so malformed docs fail CI.
