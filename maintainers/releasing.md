# Release evidence and recovery

The checked-in release and publish workflows own versioning and publication.
This checklist does not authorize a release, a registry mutation or an environment approval.

## Before publication

1. Identify the release PR, exact source commit, version, tag and intended registry account. Inspect the generated changelog and package metadata.
2. Require passing native checks: `pnpm lint`, `pnpm check:openapi`, `pnpm test:types`, `pnpm test`, `pnpm build`, and `pnpm test:package`. Verify the OpenAPI snapshot and generated output using the checked-in commands.
3. Obtain clean code and security reviews. Record the approved shared-acceptance run and exact Hosting/SDK revisions for behavior changes; dry runs and synthetic HTTP tests are not live acceptance.
4. Build the npm tarball locally, install it in a clean environment, and run the exact public quickstart. Retain its digest and inventory as candidate package-content evidence; this is not proof of the bytes the release workflow will later build.
5. Confirm explicit release authorization before any publication action. The existing automatic release path may publish after a release PR lands; a successful check or an unprotected environment is not itself release approval. Resolve authorization before merging a release PR rather than assuming `npm-production` has a human gate.

Use the existing workflows and their tag, ancestry, identity and artifact checks.
The release-triggered workflow builds after the GitHub release is published, then passes its preserved artifact to the registry job without rebuilding. A local candidate and the workflow artifact are separate builds. Authorize the source version and this workflow before triggering that path; do not claim exact-byte pre-publication approval from the local check. If approval of specific bytes is required, first add and review a build/test/approval boundary that holds that same artifact before publication. Do not retag a release or overwrite a published version.
After publication, verify the registry's package identity and version, digest/provenance where available, clean installation, and the documented quickstart against the approved platform revision.
Record the workflow URL and registry URL. Source-main tests alone do not prove the published artifact contains that source.

Both PR CI and the release build run `node scripts/test-package-quickstart.mjs package/*.tgz`.
The check installs that tarball outside the checkout without install scripts or publisher credentials,
then executes the unchanged getting-started example against synthetic local auth responses.
It checks sign-in, profile retrieval and logout and records the unchanged tarball's SHA256.
The release job uploads that tested tarball for publication. This catches package/example regressions;
it does not replace registry installation or approved live platform acceptance.

## Recover from a bad release

For an application regression, first restore its previously tested application revision and dependency lock using [the public guide](../docs/versions.md).
Confirm compatibility with current server configuration and data; an SDK downgrade does not roll either back.

Record the affected versions, symptom, safe previous version, artifact digests and any required data/server remediation in the incident or release issue.
Prepare a reviewed fix as a new version. Do not republish altered bytes under an existing version.
If package deprecation, yanking, an npm tag move or another registry action is needed, preview the exact package/version/action and obtain explicit release-owner authorization first.
Keep already published artifacts and audit evidence available unless the approved response specifically requires otherwise.

Before calling recovery verified, run clean installs and the affected application/quickstart checks for both the safe version and the proposed fix. Record actual results and remaining limits; a written rollback plan is not a performed rollback.
